# LANs and hardware
+ LAN or (Local area network) network contained locally -> requires connected devices to have compatible hardware
+  NIC or (network interface card) -> network port to connect device to a network (also known as network adapter)
+ A switch -> receives data from ports -> redirects to another port within its network
+ Physical topology used by this network is call star network

+ LAN can have several switches
+ A backbone -> central conduit -> connects segments of a network
+ A bus topology is when several devices are chained in a single line
+  A hybrid topology combines other topologies

# Routers
+ A router manages network between two or more networks -> network bridge
+ Connect LANs to internet (SOHO or small office-home office network)
+ Difference routers - switches:
	+ Router gateway between networks among many LANs
	+ A switch belongs to only one LAN 

# MANs and WANs
+ WAN (wide area network) -> group of LANs spread far away
+ MAN (metropolitan area network) -> group of connected LANs in the same geographical area
+ Both have different transmission methods and media than LANs
