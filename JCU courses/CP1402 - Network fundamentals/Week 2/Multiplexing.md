# Definition of multiplexing
+ Multiplexing, or _muxing_, is a way of sending multiple [signals](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/signal) or streams of information over a communications link at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal. When the signal reaches its destination, a process called _[[Demultiplexing]], or _demuxing_, recovers the separate signals and outputs them to individual lines.
+ Allow multiple signals to travel simultaneously over one medium
+ To carry multiple signals -> medium's channel is logically separated into multiple smaller channels  (subchannels) (like a tunnel)
+ Multiplexer (mux): device that combines many channel signals
