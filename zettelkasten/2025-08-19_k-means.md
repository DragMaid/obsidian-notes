# k-means
1. Choose k value (numeber of clusters) 
2. Randomly choose k points as centroids
3. Assign the rest of points to a cluster based on distance to centroids
4. Calculate new centroid for each
5. Repeat 3-5 times until centroids do not change

## Strengths
+ Relatively efficient
+ Easy to understand / implement

## Weakness
+ Need to specify k (sometime you don't know)
+ **Sensitive to noise and outliers**
+ Not suitable for non-globular (non-circular) shaped clusters

## Problems
+ The frickin outliers are messin up everything !!!
+ Solution: **K-Medoids** - instead of means - use the most **centrally located** object in cluster
