# Get-to-work

## Summary
+ Break user stories into tasks
+ Task Estimates
+ Complete whole usere story
+ Handle unexpected work

## User story as tasks
+ Collection of tasks -> user story

## Task
+ Task -> work needed to be done by one developer
+ Include: title / description / estimate

## Do tasks add up ?
+ What happen when two estimates don't agree (user story: 8 days, sigma tasks: 7 days) => Doesn't matter
+ User story (overall esitmate)
+ Tasks (even more detailed)
=> Good that you separate and rely on task estimates from user story est (boost confidence)

## Plot just the work you have left
+ Work or review est -> update new est
+ Time left -> update burn-down chart

## Update white board
+ Add In Progeress / Complete board / Next
+ Update burn-down chart

## Start working
+ Only put tasks that are actually in-progress into in-prog section (even if you know who'll get assigned)
=> Reflects reality (as valuable as it is accurate)

## What if working on 2 things at once ?
+ Closely related task can be done together (task 1 depends on task 2)
** Note: don't try to double up tasks with high estimates


## Standup meeting
### Requirements (it should):
+ Track progress
+ Update burn-down rate
+ Update tasks
+ Talk happened yesterday / will do today
+ Bring up issues
+ Last 5-15 mins
=> Keep everyone motivated / keep board up to date / highlight problems

** Note: You have to track unplanned tasks (be put in board / burn-down chart also)

## Talk to customer (about abrupt deadlines)
** Note: Customers set priority
=> You must re-order the board (move stories to next iteration) but just need to make sure the customers know that's the impact of their actions

## Does velocity take abrupt work into account ?
** Note: Velocityhelp gauge how fast team perform, not handle unplanned tasks
+ Formula originally: (Num of teammates) * () * (first past velocity) = velocity

## Float - extra days in schedule
+ Float is in work time - not actual time (employee going for health checkup doesn't count)

## Solutions ?
### Customer knows where you are
+ You must keep the customers involved to make sure they know the impact of their change
### You know where you are
+ Thanks to the burn-down rate & everything still visible on the wall
=> Understand progress / challangegs -> keep customer in loop -> deliver software when needed
