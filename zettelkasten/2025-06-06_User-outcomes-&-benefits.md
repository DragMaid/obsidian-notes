** Note: don't let users and their goals get lost 
    + Empathy is essential -> declare assumptions what they want: user outcomes & benefits

# Difference of outcomes
+ Outcomes for a corporate expense tracking software
    1. Busineses - company that makes the software
    2. Customers - other business that buy
    3. Users - people who use the software

# Emotional goals (for customers & users)

+ Don't ignore them - hard - but important
+ Dig into emotial aspects
