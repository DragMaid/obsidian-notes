# Box-5:-Solutions
+ Why do it now (why box 5) ? -> Cause we got all the constraints: 
1. Business problem statement
2. Business outcomes
3. Personas
4. User outcomes and benefits
=> Creativity thrives in constraints

# Affinity Mapping
+ Question: What solutions to serve personas ?
+ Brainstorm individually - Generate as many as possible
+ Sketch ideas on post-it
+ Sort similar
+ Do dot voting

# Design Studio 
+ Purpose: individual brainstomr + group critique
+ Breaks down silos
+ Createes forum for all team members POVs
+ Build trust - more frequent informal colabs
=> Don't let other people interfere your idea generation (diverge - converge)

# Design Studio - Process
+ Constraints
+ Idea gen (diverge)
+ Present + crituque
+ Select + refine (converge)

** Design Studio - Set the env:
+ No distraction - Same platform (Paper, Miro, etc)

** Note:
+ Ensure every one knows the assumptions so far (first 4 boxes) -> if not discuss
+ Idea gen (solution for each persona)

# Use sun-bird idea
+ Bring a idea from outside and integrate it into your idea (steal content)

# How to give good feedbacks
+ Remember permission to fail
+ Don't complain / ask for more detailed explanation (questions!!)
    + Example: "How does this address paint point" vs "This doesn't address pain point"

# Watch out for
+ Keep participation even (do not dominate)
+ Facilitation needs to be clear & effective
+ Encourage members (low esteem, etc)
