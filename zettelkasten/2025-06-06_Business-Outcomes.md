# Business-Outcomes
+ How do we know we solved the business problem? What measures?

# [[Problem statement]]
+ Success criteria are only high-level
    + KPIs, impact metrics
    + Helpful for business overall (not for feature-level teams)
+ Uncover leading indicators of metrics
=> What will the users do differently if our solutions work?
=> Think of a sentence that starts with a verb something to do more or less of

# [[User journey]]
# [[Pirate metrics]]
# [[Metrics mountain]]

# Facilitate te conversation
1. Start at the base. (How to acquire customers?)
2. Define plateau for each step (define user behavior)
3. Determine goal (% of users) to move to next step

# (or) use Service Journeys and User Stories Maps
+ Connects impact metrics in problem statement - lower-level customer outcomes
+ Visualize leading and lagging indicators 
    + Lagging: backwards - already happened
    + Leading: forward - things that must happen to achieve impact
** Note: watch out for metrics - not customer behaviors but look more like product decisions

# Facilitate outcome-to-impact mapping
+ Create clear connections between customer behaviors (outcomes) and impact metrics
+ See multiple ways to achive positive change
+ Use dot-voting to prioritize and pick outcomes to focus on
+ Create a baseline and goal for each outcome
+ Understand why team is working on this and why it impact metrics
