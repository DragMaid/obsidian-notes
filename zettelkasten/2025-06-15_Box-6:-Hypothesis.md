# Box-6:-Hypothesis

## Recommended template
We believe
we will achieve [business outcome]
if these [personas]
attain [user outcome]
with [solution]

## More than just "fill in blanks"
+ Write sensible hypo
+ Like a short story support design
+ Comelling hypo needs:
    + Feature has clear user
    + User gets obvious benefits
    + User behavior change helps solve [business problem]
=> If not then don't continue Solutions

## How to facilitate ?
+ Uncover gaps:
    + Outcomes - no feature
    + Featuer - do not drive customer / business value
    => Make sense of ideas

## Keep ideas specific -> create meaningful tests
+ Example: keep plant growth good -> value (the fak? Too general)

## Prioritization
+ Do not have time / money to test everything
+ Prioritze some of them so we can run tests in order

** Note:
+ Avoid hypo that are too big
+ Be specific - bout features / outcomes
+ Avoid general BS:
    + Better UX
    + Intuitive UI
    + User satisfaction
