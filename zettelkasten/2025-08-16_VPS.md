# VPS (Virutal Machine Private Server)
+ Literally just a virtual machine that is hosted in the cloud
+ Act same as virtual machines, add a virtual layer above the OS. Though you are using the same resource as other users, you still get your guaranteed share that you paid for.

## Private vs Dedicated
+ Shared hosting: you and other use single physical server. Your share is affected based on the needs of others.
+ Dedicated hosting: yours and for you only
+ VPS hosting: midpoint of both the above
