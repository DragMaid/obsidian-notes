# ROC Curves
+ Receiver Operating Characteristics curves
+ For visual comparison of classification models 
+ Shows the trade-off between the TPR and FPR
+ Area under ROC curve is measure of accuracy of model
+ Rank the test tuples in decreasing order (one that most likely belong to the positive class appears in the top of the list)
+ The closer to the diagonal  line (closer the area to 0.5), the less accurate is the model
