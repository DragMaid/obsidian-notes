# Process of design thinking 
![[Pasted image 20240918092706.png]]
1. Empathy: understand target group (e.g for visually impaired users)
	+ Observe (research) -> Understand (scope) -> Identify problem
2. Define:  listing multiple problems that can occur -> interpret the results (synthesis)
3. Ideate: choose one problem from the above list -> expand / develop solutions / ways to solve the problem
4. Prototype: create a simple test implementation of an idea -> see whether its worth or not  -> build to understand idea better 
5. Test: take prototype to users for testing (validation)
** When a stage fails or considered not addressable -> return to the previous stage **

divergent (adj): develop in different directions - less similar
convergent (adj): becoming more similar or the same
