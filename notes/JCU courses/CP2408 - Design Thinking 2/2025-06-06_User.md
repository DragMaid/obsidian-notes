# User
+ Know who is the type of the users using your poduct

# Personas
+ Understand and represent users
** Note: traditional personas can be created by third-party research team and expensive studies
=> Leads to risky knowledge gap, untouchable, unchanging

# Photo-personas
+ Current best guest about potential users
+ Start with assumptions, then re-validate
+ Photo-personas represents assumptions
+ Takes hours / not months (quick)
+ Creation is on-going / not a one-time thing
+ Update personas whenever we learn more about our users
=> Facilitate shared understanding (example:
    + We understand and tolerate tech more than customers
    + Creating photo-personas shifts focus to external users not personal
    => You are not the user - don't put personal experience in)

# Proto-persona template
+ Sketch, name, role
+ Demographic, behavorial info - "differences that actually make a difference"
+ Goals, need, desired outcomes, obstacles

# Faciliate photo-persona creation
+ Start brainstorming
+ Create list of persona types
+ Narrow down to 3-4 personas
+ Differentiate by needs and roles / not demographics
+ Complete template of each of these
+ Revise based on feedback from whole team
+ Externalize work - share beyond team

# Validate early
+ Start testing personas
+ Research to see if there are users who match personas
=> Decide does the customer exist?
=> Do they have the needs and obstacles that you think they do?
=> Would  they value a solution to this problem?
    + How they currently solve problem?
    + How likely the idea will replace this? (create a new app just to replace excel -> nah bro not a good idea)
