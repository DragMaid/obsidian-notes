# IPv4
+ 32 bits -> 4 groups of 8 bits (octets)
    + Each octet number from 0 -> 255 (8 bits can make largest number of 2^8-1)
    + Some IP addresses are reserved (ex: router default IP)
    + Example: 72.56.105.12
+ Classful addressing
    + Boundary network - host -> determined by numerical range the IP address falls in
+ Classful IPv4 divided 5 classes (A,B,C,D,E)
+ Has 2 parts: network ID and host ID (see [[2024-09-25_subnet-mask|subnet mask]] for more)

# More into IPv4 classes
+ Class A, B, C -> licensed -> available for public use on internet -> called public IP addresses
+ Company use private IP for private networks

- The IANA recommends the following IP addresses be used for private networks:
    - 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255
    - 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
    - 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255

- The range 127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255 is used for loopback â€“ allowing processes on
the same device to communicate
    - Usually 127.0.0.1, a.k.a. localhost
    - E.g., if you run a web server process, you can access it on your local browser at
    127.0.0.1

+ Classless addressing -> 
+ CIDR (classless interdomain routing) notation 
+ [[Network Address Translation (NAT)]]
+ [[Port Address Translation (PAT)]]

# How to define IP class
+ Based on starting bits of IP: 
	+ 0: class A (or decimal 0 -> 127)
	+ 10: class B (or decimal 128 -> 191)
	+ 110: class C (or decimal 192 -> 223)
	+ 1110: class D (or decimal 224 -> 239)
	+ 1111: class E (or decimal 240 -> 255)

# Specific IPv4 Structure
![[Pasted image 20241013120203.png]]
+ Version - IP version number, always 4 (e.g b0100)
+ IHL (internet header length) - in bytes (20-60 bytes)
+ DiffServ (differentiated services) - priority and quality of service level
+ Total length - header + data length in bytes (max 65535 bytes)

+ Identification, flags, fragment offset - used to identify fragments

+ TTL (time to live) - reduced by 1 everytime a packet is forwarded by a router
-> when it reaches 0 -> packet is discarded (exceed time limit)
+ Protocol - type of protocol used:
    + Number 1 - [[2024-10-07_Internet-Control-Message-Protocal-(ICMP)|Internet Control Message Protocal (ICMP)]], 
    + Number 6 - [[2024-10-13_Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)]]
    + Number 17 - [[2024-10-13_User Datagram Protocol (UDP)|User Datagram Protocol (UDP)]]
+ Header checksum
+ Source - Destination IP address

+ Options - (optional) routing and timing information
+ Padding - filler - ensure header is multiple of 32 bits
+ Data - a TCP segment, UDP datagram or ICMP message
