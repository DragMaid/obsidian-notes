# IPv4
+ 32 bits -> 4 groups of 8 bits (octets)
    + Each octet number from 0 -> 255 (8 bits can make largest number of 2**8-1)
    + Some IP addresses are reserved (ex: router default IP)
    + Example: 72.56.105.12
+ Classful addressing
    + Boundary network - host -> determined by numerical range the IP address falls in
+ Classful IPv4 divided 5 classes (A,B,C,D,E)

# More into IPv4 classes
+ Class A, B, C -> licensed -> available for public use on internet -> called public IP addresses
+ Company use private IP for private networks

- The IANA recommends the following IP addresses be used for private networks:
    - 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255
    - 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
    - 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255

- The range 127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255 is used for loopback â€“ allowing processes on
the same device to communicate
    - Usually 127.0.0.1, a.k.a. localhost
    - E.g., if you run a web server process, you can access it on your local browser at
    127.0.0.1

+ Classless addressing -> 
+ CIDR (classless interdomain routing) notation 
+ [[Network Address Translation (NAT)]]
+ [[Port Address Translation (PAT)]]
