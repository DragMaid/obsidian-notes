# SSL (Secure Sockets layer) & TLS (Transport Layer Security)
+ Both - models for encrypting TCP/IP transmissions
+ Both - work side by side - SSL/TLS or reversed
+ When a client - server establish SSL/TLS connection - establish unique session - association between client and server
    + session defined by agreement on specific set - encryption techniques
    + session create by SSL handshake protocol
