# subnet mask
# Subnet mask definition
> As the internet protocol (IP) cannot manage and define subnet itself
> The router is required to use subnet mask method to categorize these subnetworks instead
> Example of a subnet 255.255.255.0
> Router will use this subnet mask to identify which device on its local network would receive the packet
