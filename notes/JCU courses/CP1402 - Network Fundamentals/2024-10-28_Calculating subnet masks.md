# Calculating subnet masks
+ Subnetting alters - rules of classful IPv4 - called classless addressing
+ to subnet a network - borrow bits of host ID:
    + use them to represent network information
        1. Increase number of bits available for network ID (inc number of networks)
        2. Reduce bits for identifying hosts (decrease number of [[netowork host]] per network)

# IPv4 subnet Calculation
+ Steps to subnet (for both bits & formulas)
    1. Borrow bits from host ID
    2. Determine subnet mask
    3. Determine network IDs
    4. Determine the ranges of IP addrs for hosts in subnet

+ Information you will have:
    1. Number of subnets
    2. Number of host addrs per subnet
    3. Network ID for each subnet
    4. Broadcast addr for each subnet
    5. Range of host addrs for each subnet
