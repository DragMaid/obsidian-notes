# Routing Table
+ A database (a treasure map) -> shows where hosts (treasures) are located and how to get to them most efficiently
-> Routers (pirates) rely on routing table (treasure map) to find the destination of next hop -> to reach destination host
+ Contains IP addrs and network masks -> identify network that host or another router belongs to
