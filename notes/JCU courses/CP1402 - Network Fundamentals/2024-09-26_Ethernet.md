# Ethernet
# Ethernet overview
+ Adds both trailer and header to payload -> create frame around payload
+ Header + FCS make up 18-bye frame
+ Data portion of Ethernet frame 46 -> 1500 bytes

# Ethernet frames
![[Pasted image 20240926151235.png]]
+ Preamble and SFD - (8 bytes) - a warning beforehand that byte following this warning will the actual frame - not included while calculating frame size

+ Header include:

| Field name          | Length  | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Destination address | 6 bytes | Provide MAC address of recipient                                     |
| Source address      | 6 bytes | Provide MAC address of network node that originally sent the data    |
| Type Field          | 2 bytes | Specify upper layer protocol carried in the frame (e.g. IPV4 0x0800) |

+ Data - (46 -> 1500 bytes) -> will provide padding if data is less than 46 bytes
+ Trailer FCS (frame check sequence) - (4 bytes) - ensure data reieved same as data orginally sent (via [[CRC (cyclic redundancy check) algorithm]])

# MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
+ Largest size (bytes) allowed by router -> 1500 bytes for [[2024-09-26_Ethernet|Ethernet]] - standard
+ Other layer 2 technoglogies might allow higher / lower MTUs

# IEEE Ethernet Standards (cheat sheets)

# Ethernet features
+ Transmit / Receive data frames
    + Uses [[2024-09-26_Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)]] or [[Collision Detection (CD)]]
    + Decoding data frames -> check for valid MAC addresses -> pass to upper [[OSI Module]]]
    + Detect errors on data frames / network
        + Only netwrok detection / no correction
        + Frame with incorrect checksum -> error raised
        + Frame under 64 bytes length -> error raised
+ Originally designed to work on networks with a shared medium:
    + [[physical bus topology]]
    + [[star topology]] created with a hub
+ If many nodes try to communication at the same time -> signals will be interfered (called a collision)
