# Switches
+ Layer 2 devices that create Ethernet LANs
+ Examine MAC (home address) -> determine forwarding decisions -> switches are pretty much like a post office
+ Send frames out of the port connected to destination
+ Send broadcast frames out of all ports aside from port the frame came in

# Switches - Bridging Tables
+ Bridge tables - dimensional tables for addressing relationships between multiple attributes (like SQL database structure)
+ Switches associate interfaces (ports) to MAC addresses with bridge tables
+ Frame received on a given interface -> switch associates source MAC address with that interface
+ Unknown MAC address appear -> forwards frame on all ports aside from source (called "flooding")
