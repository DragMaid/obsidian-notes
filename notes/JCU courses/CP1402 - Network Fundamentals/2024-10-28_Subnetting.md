# Subnetting
+ If you borrow N bits for subnets -> have H bits for host ID:
    -> 2^N subnets, each consisting of 2^H addrs
+ With 2 addrs are unsuable for hosts:
    + subnet addr - host bits all 0s
    + broadcast addr - host bits all 1s

# What you need to know ?
1. How many subnets you need?
2. How many hosts per subnet you need?
