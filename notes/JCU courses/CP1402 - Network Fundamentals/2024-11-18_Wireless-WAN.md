# Wireless WAN
+ Designed for high throughput, long distance data transmission
+ We need to consider:
    + Fixed wireless / WiMax
    + Cellular
    + Satellite

# 802.16 (WiMAX)
+ WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability (computer ability to exchange data) for Microwave access)
    + Line-of-sight transmission between 2 atennas for use with fixed clients
    + Trans / Receive up to 50km
    + Offers installation savings and benefits over other broadband services
    + Suited for rural customers

# Cellular
+ Designed for analog phone service 
-> now can even deliver data and voice
+ This tech include the following:
    1. 1G (first generations) -> analog
    2. 2G -> digital trans to 240Kbps
    3. 3G -> data rates to 384Kbps
    4. 4G  -> characterized by (All-IP network for data and voice) (100Mbps -> 1Gbps)
    5. 5G -> services require minimum speeds of 1 Gbps and max 20 Gbps and upload of 10 Gbps

# Satellite
+ Today, satellites are used for transmitting consumer voice, video, music, and data
+ Satellite orbits:
    + Most satellites circle earth in geosynchronous orbit
    + GEO (geosynchronous earth orbit) satellites orbit at the same rate the Earth turns
    + Info transmitted to satellite in uplink from Earth-based transmitter
    + Sat Transponder -> transmit signal to Earth-based transmitter in downlink
    + GEO sats -> most popular for data service providers
+ Sat Internet Services:
    + Offer high-bandwidth internet access via GEO sat links
    + Sat services often asymmetrical (bandwidth shared among subscribers) 
    + Throughput vary and controlled by service provider
