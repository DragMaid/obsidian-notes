# Atennas
+ Wireless signals - originate from electrical current traveling along a conductor
+ Electrical signal travels from transmitter -> attena -> emits signal as series of electromagnetic waves
    -> at destination -> another antenna accepts signal -> convert back to current to be processed
+ 2 Atennas -> must be same freq -> to use same channel

# Radiation pattern
+ Describes relative strength (3D area) of all electromagnetic energy that was sent / received

# Directional / Undirectional antenna
+ Issues wireless signals along a single direction

# Omnidirectional antenna 
+ Issues and receives wireless signals with equal strength, clarity in all directions

# Range
+ Geopgraphical area that atenna can reach is its **range**

# [[Signal Propagation]]
