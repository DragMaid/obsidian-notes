# Domain Name System (DNS)
+ Character-based name -> easier to remember than IP
+ Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) -> full name of host (ex: www.google.com)
+ [[Uniform resource locator (URL)]]
+ Last part of FQDN -> top-level domain (TLD)
+ Domain name must be registered by authorized organization on behalf of (ICANN - Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
+ Name resolution -> discover IP address of host after FQDN is known
+ DNS -> application layer - client / server system made up of:
    1. Namespace - collection of computer names with IP addresses stored in DNS databases around the globe
    2. Name servers - hold databases - organized in hierarchical structure
    3. Resolvers - DNS client that requests information from DNS servers
