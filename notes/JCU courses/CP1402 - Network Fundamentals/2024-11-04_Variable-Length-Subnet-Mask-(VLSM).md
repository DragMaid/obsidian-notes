# Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)
+ Allows subnets to be further subdivided -> smaller groupings -> until size = necessary IP address space
+ To create VLSM -> create largest subnet first -> smaller ones after

=> Instead of dividing into equal subnets -> maybe overkill for some and cause inefficient space for others
