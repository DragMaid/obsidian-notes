# Routing Protocols
+ Used by routers -> communicate -> determine best path
+ Routers' reliabilty & priority valued based on:
    1. Administrative distance (AD) - number - shows reliability
    2. Convergence time - time to recognize best path after network change / outage
    3. Overhead - burden on network to support protocol
