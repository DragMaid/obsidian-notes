# subnet
# Subnet definition
> Dividing the huge al mighty network into smaller sections for easier navigations
> Image having to deliver mail for 10 house scattered around the whole city vs within your local district only
> -> subnet is created to group and guide direct transmission -> increased efficiency

## Another interpretation of the problem:
You (local device) -> write a letter and send it (via local router) -> send a letter to Alice's company address (since you dont know exact address of her home)
-> The company (external) router receive the letter (packet) -> read the specific description (subnet) using its categories (subnet masks)
-> send packet to specific department (accounting, markteting, ... or subnet) -> another one inside that subnet send it to Alice
