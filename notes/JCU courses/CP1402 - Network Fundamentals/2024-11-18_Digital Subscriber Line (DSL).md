# Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
+ WAN connection method that operates over [[Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)]]
+ Supports multiple data and voice channels over a single line
    1. Require repeaters for longer distances
    2. Distance affects throughput
+ DSL uses advanced data modulation techniques
+ Might use modulation techniques based on [[amplitude]] or [[phase modulation]] -> alter waves at higher freq to carry data


# Types of DSL
+ Varies depend on: (called xDSL where x is replaced by any character)
    1. Throughput rate
    2. Data Modulation techniques
    3. Capacity
    4. Distance limitations

+ Well known types:
    1. ADSL (asymmetric) -> download speed > upload speed 
        + Most common
        + Used in viode conferencing and web surfing
    2. VDSL (Variable / Very high bit rate DSL) - the same but faster than ADSL
    3. SDSL (symmetric) -> download speed = upload speed
        + Best used when dowloading / uploading large data
