# IPv6 Subnets
+ Simpler than IPv4 subnets in these ways:
    1. IPv6 addr -> no classes
    2. IPv6 -> no subnet masks
    3. Single IPv6 subnet can supply a lot of addresses

# Structure
+ Commonly written as eight blocks of 4 hexadecimal characters -> divided like:
    1. Last 4 -> interface ID
    2. First 4 -> network ID and network prefix (called site prefix or global routing prefix)
    3. 4th decimal block -> be used to create subnets
