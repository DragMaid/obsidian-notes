# IPv6
+ Has 128 bits -> divided into 8 blocks of hexadecimal (16 based numeric alphabet) numbers separated by colons
+ One character in hexadecimal = 4 bits in binary -> Each block has 16 bits -> 4 hexadecimal character per block
+ Leading zeros in first hex block -> can be eliminated
+ if one block -> all 0000 -> replace with "::" (but only once)
+ Ex: • 2001::B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC -> • 2001::B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC (both fine but second is preferred)

# IPv6 terminologies
+ A (local) link -> any device connected via the same LAN
+ Neighbors -> two nodes or more connected via the same LAN
+ Dual stacked -> network configured to use both [[2024-10-06_IPv6|IPv6]] and [[2024-10-04_IPv4|IPv4]]`
+ Tunneling -> method used by IPv6 to send packets to IPv4
+ Interface ID -> 64 bits of the last 4 blocks of IPv6 address -> idenitfy the interface

# Types of IPv6 interfaces
+ Unicast address -> define a single node on the network
    + Global address -> routed on the internet (like the [[2024-10-06_Network Address Translation (NAT)|Network Address Translation (NAT)]])
    + Link local address -> communicate any nodes on the same link
    + Loopback address -> test wether a protocal is functioning properly (::1 for IPv6)

    + Multicast address -> spam all
    + Anycast address -> specify destinations -> deliver to closest

# IPv6 autoconfiguration
+ Desgined to allow computers to have custom local link addresses
+ Proccess is called SLAAC (stateless address autoconfiguration)
+ Step 1:
    - Set prefix (FE80::/64) (first 64 bits)
    - The other last generated from network adapter's MAC address
+ Step 2: verify uniqueness
+ Step 3: Ask router if he can cook -> assign new address if yes - called RS (router solicitation)
