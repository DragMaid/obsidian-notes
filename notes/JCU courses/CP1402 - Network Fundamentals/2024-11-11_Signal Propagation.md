# Signal Propagation
+ Refers to the **way** wave travel from one point to another
+ LOS (line-of-sight) -> occurs when signal travels in 1 straight line (transmitter -> receiver)
+ Wireless signals dont often goes in LOS
+ Obstacle in way -> it may:
    1. Pass object
    2. Be obsorbed by object


# Anttenuation
+ Further from source -> weaker
    -> amplified - by inc power of transmission
    -> extend - by [[wireless range extender]]

# Fading
+ when signal slam into obstacle -> fade
=> Fading too much -> dropped connections / slow data trans

# Interference
+ Electromagnetic waves - can interfere wireless communications
+ Wireless signals more vulnerable to [[Physical transmissions#noise]]
+ Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) -> proportion of noise to the strength of signal


# Refraction
+ wave goes through obj -> speed, wavelength changes (or refracted)

# Reflection
+ wave meet obj -> reflected or bounced back to source

# Scattering
+ wave meet obj (small surface dimensions compared to wavelength) -> diffused and scattererd in many directions

# Diffraction
+ when signal diffracted, split when it encouters an obstruction
=> Signals follow different paths -> **multipath signals**
