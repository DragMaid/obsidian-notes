# SVM vs Neural Network
## SVM
+ Relatively new
+ or all possible -> select best outcome)
+ Nice generalization props
+ Hard to learn
+ Using kernels - can learn very complex funcs

## Neural Network
+ Relatively old
+ Non-deterministic algo
+ Generalize well - but has no strong mathmetical foundation
+ Easily learnt in incremental fashion
+ To learn complex func - use multilayer perceptron
