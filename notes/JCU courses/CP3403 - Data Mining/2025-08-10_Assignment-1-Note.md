# Assignment-1-Note

## Introduction
+ State the general reason of why you are trying to do the project and some of the potential application

## Business scenario
+ The types of algorithms that are use and for what specific feature ?

## Dataset description
+ Description of the dataset and why it fits the criteria
+ Core goal to use the dataset to achieve original purpose

## Data Preprocessing
1. Handle missing values
2. Feature engineering
3. Target Variable Dicretization

## Methodology
### ARM
What algorithm was chosen and for what reason ? 
What specific parameters was used ?
What form of pre-processing was chosen ? 
**Note**: include some of the code along the way

### Classification
Use 2 algorithms here and explain why you choose one of each 
How was the dataset split into train / testin datasets ?
What transformation was perfomed on the dataset before fed to the algorithm ?
What form of checking was performed ? (confusion matrix ?)

### Clustering
Same like the above 

## Results and Analysis
### EDA
Feature distribution (plot out the charts)

### Classification analysis
Performance comparison (for classification)

## Clustering analysis

# Conclusion
Based on the goals set in the start to make a conclusion



# Code exploration

## Current winners
1. Pre-processing: Kato
2. ARM: Jason
3. Classification: Kato, Georgii
4. Clustering: Kato, Georgii
