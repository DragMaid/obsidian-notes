# Apriori

## Prunning principle
+ If any itemset is infrequent, its superset should not be generated or tested

## Method
+ Scan once - get frequent 1-itemset
+ Generate k+1 candidate itemsets from above
+ Test candidates against DB
+ Terminate when no frequent or candidate set can be generated 

## Bottleneck
### Challanges
+ Multiple scan of whole db
+ Huge number of candidates
+ Tedious workload of support couting
