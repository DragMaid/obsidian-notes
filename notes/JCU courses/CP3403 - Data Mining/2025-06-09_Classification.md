# Classification
+ Learn from observations (training data) and predict labels (discrete or nominal)of unseen observations
+ [[#Supervised Learning (Classification)]] with predefined classes
+ Applications: credit card approval, target marketing, medical diagnosis, ...


## Supervised Learning (Classification)
+ The training data are acompanied by labels indicating the class of the observations
+ New data is classified base on the training set

## Unsupervised learnning (Clustering)
+ Class labels of training data is unknown


## Clasification procedure
+ Train data -> Build a classifier (initial models) -> validation data -> Refined model -> Test data (check if its good enough) -> Validating classifier (final model)

## Summary
+ Need: training sets
+ Goal: predict class labels of unseen data
+ How: Build rules (classifiers) to predict (classify) unseen data
+ Validate: Test rules with exisiting data

## Forms of classifications models
+ Instance space
+ [[2025-06-16_Bayesian Classification|Bayesian Classification]]
+ [[Artificial Neural network]]
+ [[2025-08-19_Decision Tree Indunction|Decision Tree Indunction]]
+ Functions (linear regression)
+ etc ...
