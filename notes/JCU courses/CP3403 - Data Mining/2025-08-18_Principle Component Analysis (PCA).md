# Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
+ Goal: reduce a set of numerical variables
+ The idea: remove overlap of information. Make it easier to visualize rather than juet the original 2 axis that limit the view of all the data. With the information will now be calculated using the sum of variance of the variables
+ Final product: a number of numerical varaibles (principal components) that contain the most information
