# DBSCAN
+ Cluster based on density
+ Discover clusters of arbitrary shape
+ Handle noise
+ One scan
+ Need density params as termination condition

## Parameters
+ **Eps**: max radius of neighborhood
+ **MinPts**: min number of points in eps-neighborhood

## Density-Reachable / Connected
![[Pasted image 20250819142555.png]]
+ Density-reachable: one of the point can be a border point (not core-point)
+ Density-connected: all points must be core-point

## Process
+ Select a point p
+ Retrieve all points density-reachable
+ If p is a core point -> form a cluster there
+ If p is a border point, no points are density-reachable from p -> visits next point in the database
+ Continue the process until all points have been processed

## Strengths
+ Centre-based density to determine clusters -> resistant to noise
+ Can identify noise data -> good for anomoly analysis
+ Can identify clusters of various shapes and sizes

## Weaknesses
+ No automatic way to fnd optimal MinPts and Eps
+ Use global constants for both MinPts and Eps
+ Centre-based density become problematic for high dimensionality data
