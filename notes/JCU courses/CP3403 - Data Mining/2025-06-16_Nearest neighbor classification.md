# Nearest neighbor classification

## Instance based methods
+ Store training examples - delay processing (lazy evaluation) till new instance must be classified
+ Typical approaches
    + K-nearest neighbor approach
        + Instances represented as points in a Euclidean space
    + Case-based reasoning
        + Use symbolic representations and knowledge-based inference

## K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm
+ All instances - mapped to points to n-D space
+ Nearest neighbor defined in terms of Euclidean distance
+ Target func could be discrete or real valued
