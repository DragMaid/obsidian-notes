# Training & Testing
- Training data - for learning parameters of model
+ Validation data - for deciding what type of model works best
+ Test data - for getting final, unbiased estimate of how well classifier works

# Problems
## Common mistakes
+ Learning (Training) data = Test data
+ Estimate accuracy on new data by accuracy on learning data (resubstitution accuracy) (ask same shit ?? for what ??)

## Size of data set
+ Test set should be representative of new data
+ No problem when available data abounds

## Scarce data
+ Needs a lot of data

# Data Partition
+ Ways to split data into training set / test set
+ Some of them may includes:
    + [[Resubstituition]] (bad)
    + [[Hold-out]]
    + [[Cross-validation]]
    + [[Leave-one-out]]
    + [[Bootstrap]]

# [[Classification Accuracy]]

# [[Technques for Classification]]
