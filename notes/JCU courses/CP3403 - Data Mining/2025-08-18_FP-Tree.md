# FP-Tree
For each pattern-base:
    + Accumulate all transformeed prefix paths
    + Construct FP-tree for frequent items of pattern base
=> Therefore its runtime is way faster than [[2025-08-18_Apriori|APriori]]

## Problem: Too many patterns
+ Any sub-pattern of a frequent pattern is also a frequent pattern
=> Therefore for frequent pattern {A,B,C} so is frequent for {A,B}, {A,C}, ..., {B}, {C}
=> Solution: Mine only [[#Closed patterns]] or [[#Max patterns]]

## Closed patterns
+ Itemset X is **closed** if:
    + X if frequent (> min-support)
    + There is no super-pattern Y with same support as X
=> Closed patterns are lossless compression of frequent patterns

## Max patterns
+ Itemset X is a **max pattern** if 
    + X is frequent 
    + There's no frequent super-pattern Y (bruh it just removed the part behind)
