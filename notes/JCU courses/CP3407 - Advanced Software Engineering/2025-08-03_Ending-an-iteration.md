## What we don't have
+ [ ] Process improvements
+ [ ] System testing (unit test - users > tester)
+ [ ] Refactoring of code using lessons you've learned (slick -> sliker)
+ [ ] Code cleanup and documentation updates (documented ?)
+ [ ] More design patterns? (same as name)
+ [ ] Development environment updates(try new tools)
+ [ ] R&D on a new tech you're considering (learn new tech to include)
+ [ ] Personal development time to let people explore new tools or read (same as above)
