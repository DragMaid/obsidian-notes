# Planning
+ circle the ones you think you should develop to come up with a chunk of work that will take no longer than 90 days
+ Picking the user stories

## Customer stes priorities
+ Stay cistomer-focused -> when deciding whats in / out (may ask export) -> but final choice is from customer

## Prioritize with customer
+ Customer choose priority (lay out all cards and make them label each)

## "Milestone 1.0"
+ First major release
+ First time you deliver your software (and expect to be paid)
+ DO .. balance functionality with customer impatience (make them know what was able during that time)
+ DON'T .. get caught planning nice-to-haves (deliver only what's needed)
+ DON'T .. worry about length (yet) (need to know priority first - other will get noted later)

## Sanity check M1 estimate
+ Add usr stories estimates for M1

## Feature don't fit -> Re-prioritize
+ Customer might still want to lower the dev time -> reprioritize till workable
+ Steps to do this:
1. Cut more functionalities (only absolutely crucial)
