# CP3401---Assignment-2

## Current plan for the exam
1. Complete the hype cycle
2. Complete Data Mining
3. Improve the dataset / gameflow for cat captcha
4. Prepare for examination (revision + reference book)

## What you need to do
1. Read the articles for information
2. Choose **one** of the emerging technologies
3. Write substantive report (around 3000 words in length) (exclude reference)


A suggested structure for your report could be as follows:
• Title
    • Technology Overview 
    • Definition and Nature 
    • Historical Background
    • Present State of Development and Gartner Hype Cycle Position
    • Other Pertinent Details
• SWOT Analysis of the Technology (TODO: research about this)
    + Strengths
    + Weakness
    + Opportunities
    + Threats
    + How to write:
        1. Determine objective
        2. Gather resources
        3. Compile ideas
        4. Refine findings
        5. Develop strategy
    + Common mistakes:
        1. Failing to be objectie and honest in the assessment
        2. Analyzing in isolation (without input from diverse key stakeholders) 
        3. Neglecting to prioritize the factors identified in SWOT analysis (not all attributes are equal -> discriminate the major from the insignificant points)

• Current Utilisations and Applications, including Innovations and Ethical Considerations
• Present Level of Maturity and Future Forecasts (TODO: research about this)
• References (conforming to IEEE style)


## Marking Criteria

discussed): 17%
• Evaluation of Current Maturity, Future Predictions, and Gartner Hype Cycle Position: 20%
• Structure & organisation: 17%
• References (using IEEE referencing style): 13% - See: https://libguides.jcu.edu.au/IEEE

## Research - Gartner Hype Cycle
### AI in HR
+ Provide predicive insights, make recommendations, infer information, generate text or provide conversational user interface

### AI in Skills Management and Internl Talent Marketplaces
+ Language processing, knowledge graphs -> build dynamic representation of skills data -> auto tag and recommend learning content + connect wit experts across teams
+ Internal Talent Marketpklaces (ITMs) -> platforms that match workers to work  -> removes the need for HR -> peak of inflated expectations (obstacle: lack cultural readiness for dynamic - adaptive organizational modals)

### HR Virtual Assistants
+ Work with human voice / text -> assist employees in completing HR tasks or requests -> Trough of Disillusionment
+ Reduce time it takes to get support / information / complete HR tasks
=> Increase value of HR inter actions / better employee experience 
=> Still lag behind in supporting advanced use cases / benchmark set for available chatbots is difficult to match in the near term

### Wtf do HRs even do ?
+ Definition: responsible for managing employee life cycle (recruit / hire / fire)
+ Possible jobs:

#### Hiring
+ Not only spam it -> analyze market / consult stakeholders -> plan budget beforehand
+ Understand the business well -> find / attract the right worker -> good one can improve company while bad one can disrupt the flow
+ In charge of scheduling interviews 

#### Process payroll (top priority)
+ Deduct taxes
+ Collect total hours
+ Reimburse expenses
+ factor in raises and bonuses

#### Conduct disciplinary actions
+ Instead of fire + hire new (costly)
+ HR is the detective -> find reason -> suggest solutions
+ Or even decide if there should be a disciplinary action or just fukin let them go

#### Update policies
+ Be done every year to reflect organization changes (always need these mfs to be included and receive consultant from them)

#### Maintain employee record
+ Help identify skill gaps to help with hiring process / analyze demographic data, comply with regulations
+ Contain personal details & emergenc contacts for each employee

#### Other operational tasks
1. Provide career growth
2. Offer education (assist / send employees to additonal training)
3. Train + Support Managers 
4. Support health and wellness

### Reference of some of the past studies
1. How did they structure their essays ?
+ Introduce about the product, the hype around it and then analyze the potential benefits that it might bring (often reduction in cost (not only in terms of cash but also time / deatch which would then ultimately be converted to cash))
+ One good thing to do would be to show the prediction with (especially good if you split it into phases (this is usually already done by third party organizations so what you're probably doing is really just citing their words))
+ Remember to show which part of the curve that current trend is on 

2. Which content / information was included ?
3. How was the Gartner Hype Cycle utilised ?
