# Structuer-of-Adwords
+ Account -> Campaign -> Adgroups -> Keywords -> Ad

# Google Adwords
+ Start organizing - 
+ Create campaign - check popularity (with objectives and goals):
    + Ex: Into international / domestic campaigns or as increasing visitors and increasing brand awareness
+ One campaign - one goal
+ Adgroups are theme or product based
    + 25% discounted room (theme)
    + Single room (prod based)
+ Keywords must be theme based
    + 25% discounted room -> cheap and affordable
    + Single room -> private and quiet
+ Adgroups: better start by being too specific rather than too broad

# Keywords
+ 10-15 keywords per adgroup
+ Be specific as possible
+ Consider terms used by customers:
    + Used car > old cars / pre-owned cars
    + Cheap > low prices
+ Adgroups are themed based -> keyword specific to theme

# Keywords Tips
+ Think like customer
+ Organized by theme
+ Be specific (general -> might be irrelevant)
+ Use keyword planner -> (metrics / forecasts for keywords)
+ Find new keywords
+ Use Google to search for sth and will show you associated keywords
+ Use third party (keywordtool.io)
+ Use keyword match wisely:
    + Broad match / closely related: attrac customers but no interest
    + Phrase match: Use quote symnol to match
    + Exact match: (order does not matter) -> use bracket
