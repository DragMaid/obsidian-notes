# Hype-cycle-&-Block-Chain
![[Pasted image 20250718130959.png]]
Concept -> Burst (early adopters) -> Everybody follow -> Failure and Flaws (discovered later) -> Fixes -> Producitivity

# Blockchain
+ Distributed Ledger Technology
+  Block: digital pieces of info (transact info, id / hash)  (literally a linked list)
=> Decentralized, distributed ledger (public or private) of different kinds of transactions arranged into P2P network
# DLT
+ Ledger:
	+ Record of transactions
	+ Central authority required
+ Distributed Ledger: 
	+ No central authority

# How does blockchain work:
+ Reaching consensus: 
	+ Proof of Work
	+ Proof of Stake
	+ Proof of Authority
	+ Round robin

## Proof of Work (PoW)
+ Complex  puzzle -> verify transactions - determine update to ledger
+ First miner to sole puzzle receives reward

## Characteristics of blockchain
+ Immutability: can't be altered (need consent from majority of nodes)
+ Decentralized (less failure, user control, transparency, no scams)
+ Enhanced security (information is hashed -> change one -> change all previous hash ids)
+ Consensus (decision making from all nodes)
+ Smart Contract (optional):
	+ Immutable: deployed -> can't be changed
	+ Deterministic: outcome -> same for anyone who runs it
	+ Decentralized: runs on every node (same final state) 

# Transform E-business with blockchain
## Payment
+ Cryptocurrency:
	+ Bitcoin, Ethereum, ...
+ Goods:
	+ Same (decentralized, identity protection, reduce fraud)

 ## Supply chain management
 + Provenance tracking 
 + Cost reduction
 + Inventory management
## Transparent marketplace
+ Same (but all sellers are monitored)

##  Secure e-platform
+ large centralized data (vulnerable) -> privacy (with blockchain)

## Product review
+ Fake reviews -> curb false comments / require verification / unaltered after added 

# Practical 7
+ How to use hype cycles: Clients use Hype Cycles to get educated about the promise of an emerging technology within the context of their industry and individual appetite for risk

+ Should you make an early move? If you’re willing to combine risk-taking with an understanding that risky investments don’t always pay off, you could reap the rewards of early adoption.

+ Is a moderate approach appropriate? Executives who are more moderate understand the argument for an early investment but will also insist on a sound cost/benefit analysis when new ways of doing things are not yet fully proven.  

+ Should you wait for further maturation? If there are too many unanswered questions around the commercial viability of an emerging technology, it may be better to wait until others have been able to deliver tangible value.

- What were the emerging technologies in 2005?
	+ Corporate Semantic Web
	+ Text Mining
	+ Augmented Reality
	+ Business Process Networks
	+ Model-Driven approaches
	+ Carbon nano tubes
	+ Podcasting
	+ Inkjet Manufacturing
	+ P2P VoIP
    
- Where are they standing now? 
	+ P2P VoIP, Podcasting, 4G, Digital Paper,  Linux on Desktop, Text Mining at plateau of productivity
	+ Quantum Computing, DNA logic, prediction markets peak of inflation expectations
	+ Don't know about nanotube (maybe it died halfway)
    
- Have they gone through the Gartner maturity cycle?
	Most of them do, except some that just died off in the progress (nanotube)
