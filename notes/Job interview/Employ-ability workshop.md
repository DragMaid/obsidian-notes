** Note: Show the experience you had in your personal / group project at university

## [[STAR format]]:
+ dedicates too much time to background info 
+ sounds rather robotic
+ no 'learning' -> only 'results' shown

[[CARL format]] (better):
+ Context
+ Action
+ Result (always make sure that it is measurable)
+ Learning (needed to see your growth after the process)
** Note: also talks about insight to take action (why come to the final decision)


# Questions unanswered:
1. For CARL format (what is the adequate scope / range)

# Motivation
## Sample: Why do you want to work at this company ?
## Structure
+ Reason -> why this resonate 

** Note: learn about talking to hiring team members before the interview (cultural aspect, employee reference)
