![[Pasted image 20240920142630.png]]
_“User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.” –[Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/)_

_User experience (UX) design_ is a human-centered design discipline that addresses the holistic experience of a product, focused on:

- **User journey**: The entire process surrounding use of a product, from the problem to be solved through the impact of the solution.
- **User research**: Qualitative and quantitative research to put the user at the center of the design process.
- **Deliverables** to document the user experience and define the workflows and features of a product or design, such as:
- **[Personas](https://www.codecademy.com/article/ui-design-personas)**: Summaries of example and target users, generally based on a composite of user research.
- **[Journey maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/)**: A timeline of user actions related to accomplishing a particular goal related to a product or design.
- **[Storyboards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/)**: A sequence of panels (often resembling a comic book) depicting a user story chronologically.
- **[Prototypes](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/prototyping)**: Iterative models, sketches or **wireframes** of a design used to gather feedback and inform the final design.

# Five elements of UX design
![[Pasted image 20240920142846.png]]
1. Strategy: target audience? fix what? -> user needs, business goals
2. Scope: functional requirements and content requirements (for phones - screen size? storage? default apps?)
3. Structure: interaction design / information architecture (how contents are organized) - e.g. what will a button do? what can be accessed via home screen?
4. Skeleton: how information is presented and arranged -> producing wireframe
5. Surface:  emphasizes visual design (color, typefaces, UI design)

# Users and End-Users
+ User is someone ho might use or maintain a product
+ End-user is the person ultimately intended to use the product (may have less technical background)
