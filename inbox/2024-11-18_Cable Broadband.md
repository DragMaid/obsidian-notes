# Cable Broadband
+ Also called (cable internet) or (cable modem access) -> based on coaxial cable wiring for TV signals
+ based on standardised by international cooperative effort (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS))
+ Service is often offered at asymmetric speeds (download > upload speed)
+ Newest DOCIS standard is 4.0 allows for symmetric multi-gigabit speeds up to to 10 Gbps downstream / 6 Gbps upstream
+ Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC):
    + Use [[Cooper and fiber wires#fibre-optic-cable]] -> connect company distribution center -> distribution hubs and then to optical nodes near customers

# Cable Modem
+ Cable modem modulates and demodulates signals for transmission and receptio via cable
+ May connect to connectivity device (router or switch)
+ Possible to use device that combines cable modem func with ((SOHO router)) -> share available bandwidth with entire network
+ Provides a dedicated and conitnuous connection
+ require many subscribers to share the same local line -> raises concern about security and throughput

# Fibre
+ ISP are offering WAN connections:
    1. Fibre-to-(node / neighbourhood) (FTTN)
    2. Fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC)
    3. Fibre-to-the-building (FTTB) or Fibre-to-home (FTTH)
+ Metropolitan Optical Networks (MONs) -> bring fibre to customer

# Leased Lines
+ Provide dedicated bandwidth on fibre optic connections
+ Offer these advatages:
    1. Dedicated bandwidth
    2. Symmetrical bw
    3. SLA-backend guarantee
+ Month costs based on:
    1. Required bandwidth
    2. Distance to ISP's exchange or between company's own locations
